Hi! I'm Kai, And I Develop Things.

I Mainly Develop(ed) In python, But as of recently, I've been programming Apps & Languages In C++.

My Main Versions are C++12, 15, and 20.

I've Always had an obsession of Contribution & Helping Others with Certain Projects/Ideas.

I'm Not too into Profit, I Develop Open-Source most of the time. I'd Usually Private a Repository Such as A Language, Or A App That i spent very Long on. 

Projects Usually Take around 1-10 Days to finish the First Stable Releases, kliJnce#5000 Is my discord, And Also another place to get in contact with me.
I Also Bare a couple of Aliases/Nicknames Such as kliJnce, KaiTheCodeManager, And KaiScripts.
